title: Homonormo by Arthur Moon
subtitle: Song of the ... Month?
---

Arthur Moon, according to Arthur Moon, is queering pop. And boy, can you hear it in Homonormo, is this hypnotic, distorted pop song on a San-Junipero-Type beat (in that it’s sunshiney but also, layered, and is set over a techno backdrop).

The mixing of the drums and the vocals. We start off with just a basic beat, and then Åshuvud (the lead singer of Arthur Moon), sings, “I woke up and the sun was shining”. But the thing is, the drums come in during the music at atypical times — it’s hard to explain so here’s an example. When Åshuvud sings the chorus, it goes like this: 

> “Hello, send my” beat “regards to” beat “New York” 

I’m sure there’s some actual musical term for what’s going on here, but whatever it is, it works — it adds a cool layer of complexity to Homonormo while maintaining it’s bop status. 
 
This song just combines so many things that I always wanted to see together: that play-in-the-afternoons-sway-and-sing-along feeling that a particular brand of indie music manages to capture, and yet an experimental flair in the production, with clear techno fluences and heavy voice pitch correction + layering. It’s like techno, indie, pop, experimental, genius at once. The melody on the main chorus line is so well done—”I think I wanna settle down, but weirder.” Like it has a motion to it, and you feel like you should be banging your head along to it. Also, bonus points: this song makes me want to like, be a professor in New York City with a lot of connections on the board of the MoMA, except I spend most of my days at a café in Greenwich instead of in my office, and I take down notes for new project ideas in this old-fashioned leather bounded journal.
