This is going to be a very fast, un-edited writeup because I have a currently nonexistent discrete math assignment that needs to exist, soon. But I’ve been listening to Sunblind off the new Fleet Foxes album on repeat for the last three days, and I can’t let it go unblogged about any longer.  

Wasn’t going to listen to the new Fleet Foxes album. Didn’t even know it was coming out. Fleet Foxes is a band I usually categorize as “pretty good” background music, but not worth following. And I’ve pretty much just had the same four Ryan Beatty songs and [Meet Me in the City by Junior Kimbrough](https://open.spotify.com/track/5LmmZgxFg1sSfxENxsdtak?si=9THkYzGYRDO4vm43CETlrw) on repeat for the last month—but then Omeed recommended the album, so I had to. 

I listened to the whole album in one sitting while on a late night Zoom—and unexpectedly, I really really liked it. I don’t think it’s an album you can listen to while doing nothing else, but at about 60-70% concentration, it’s perfect. Lots of seamless transitions.

I’m too lazy to re-type out my thoughts on the album, so I’ll literally just screenshot this:

Out of the whole 54 minute album, Sunblind is my undisputed favorite.

The instrumentals are warm and glittering, like the late afternoon sun on the Pacific Ocean (NorCal version). There are no wheels being reinvented, but the song just feels so impossibly familiar and wonderful to me. It has that feeling of building catharsis and symphony that [**Third of May / Ōdaigahara**](https://open.spotify.com/album/3HnloalXZ1JZ9O9DVgI6zC) does so well.

The chorus is just lovely: 


> I’m gonna swim for a week in <br>
> Warm American water with dear friends<br>
> Just intending that I would delight them<br>
> Swimming high on a lea in an Eden

“Warm American water with dear friends”—that line just feels like such a Core Memory™. The entire song—nay, album—does. That line just—like, I know what he means, even though I don’t. 

There’s also a lot of references / homages to other musical artists embedded in the song, but you can find all that on [Genius](https://genius.com/Fleet-foxes-sunblind-lyrics). 

Sunblind feels like it’s about serenity and rebirth and contentment and—Jaide is going to kill me—healing. I’ve been really vibing with all of those things recently, so in a crazy way, it feels like I found the song at the exact right time. Like it was released for me. And it’s awesome when a song feels like that. 

Also, the first line of the final verse just won me over completely:


> In your rarified air I feel sunblind

Every time I think that human beings have exhausted all possible ways to say ‘I love you’, someone comes out with *In your rarified air I feel sunblind.* Like, I’m gonna write this down in a notebook and save it for years later. I need someone to use this as wedding vow ASAP.
