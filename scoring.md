### 10.0 = My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy

This isn't your album of the year. It's your album of the decade. 
This score is for the self-imposed exile in Hawaii after the 2009 VMAs, I made a 9-minute song toasting to douchebags that starts with half a minute of literally just piano keys and ended it with 3 minutes of completely distorted singing and instrumental and it's freaking genius, could-be-considered-perfect, every single second on this album has a purpose type stuff.

### 0.0 = Whatever Shawn Mendes' album(s) is/are.  

Or that equivalent level of music. Sorry. He seems like a nice enough guy, but. You know how it is.
