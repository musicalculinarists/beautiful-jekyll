## Lyrical Highlights


> You'd be the mercy under my cruelty
> My revelation bloodshed free


> Where the blue grass creeps over top
> Decades of devotion
> Warm underneath the frost


> We can build a home in a bush of azalea
> Dress it up in true morale paraphernalia


> We can be defined by the things we want
> I'll be a life full of free haircuts from the one that I love
> We'll collect fallen out teeth in a candy jar
> Mice for the backyard peregrine falcon reservation

This stuff is straight up poetry. 
But to be honest, this entire damn song is a lyrical highlight. 

There are some artists (Father John Misty and Hozier come to mind) who transform love songs into what we don’t typically imagine love to be like — intimate, imperfect, obsessive. Bendigo Fletcher nailed this feeling on Wonderfully Bizarre, with the lead singer’s almost desperate cry *“Do you wanna get married?”.* 
And the musicality™ is pretty damn unique. For example, at ~3:40 a robotic, talkbox sounding voice breaks through the strum of guitar to tell us *“Bad dreams, you never get away” —* an unexpected but genius addition to an already amazing song.
