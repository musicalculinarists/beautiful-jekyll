subtitle: Ever have friends who you know are good people, but just have unforgivably trash music taste? This is the post that will help you show those sinners the light.

Let‚Äôs admit it, good music exists on a spectrum. Sometimes, you can‚Äôt throw the kids into the deep end all at once, you know? Floaties first. 

Below, you‚Äôll find a set of beautifully illustrated (that‚Äôs right, we know graphic design üòé ) directed acyclic graphs for your perusal that will have even the biggest Maroon 5 fans in the world shouting along to JPEGMAFIA. 

First, for your friends who think ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs Plan‚Äù is the hop song of the decade:

Next, converting your friends from basic indie to‚Ä¶ insanely good indie. I know we all want to smoke and chill to Tame Impala, but let‚Äôs not forget that Rostam and Young Fathers are making music, too? Like there‚Äôs a whole other world waiting for us.

Ah, pop. The genre traditionally lampooned the most by angsty teens and boomers alike. But pop can actually lead you into some really good sounds, if you‚Äôre looking in the right places. Here‚Äôs how to get your friends from more ‚Äústandard pop‚Äù into some truly good music.

We‚Äôve all got that one friend who refuses to listen to music made after 1973. Here‚Äôs how you can catch them up with the times.
