whisper 

> I love you from the space beneath my feet,
> And beneath that, and beneath that

messy

> I’ve been sitting alone for hours
> Waiting for you to bring your ugliest parts to me
> I’ve been naming our thorns for hours
> Hoping you’ll treat them as kindly as you treated me
> Oh, I've been thinking like a beast for hours
> Wondering if you like the challenge of grooming me
> After I glamour you for hours
> Will you have the strength, the strength to extinguish me?


> Boy, I’m hungry but all my knives are dull
> Will you sharpen your teeth to hunt and keep me full


> When you’re burnt out and you’re praying for rain
> Can I wish for flood? Is that okay?

fragrant

> I called all your ex-boyfriends and asked them for a kiss
> I needed to know if they still carried your fragrance
> Baby boy, as their mouths, their mouths consumed mine
> Their lips were sweet as yours, I hope your flavor stays in mind

mourning song

> I’m sure my friends are tired of me talking about you
> But it’s a gift, it’s a gift to miss you
> What kind of lover would I be if I didn’t properly grieve?

cherubim

> Boy, every time I worship you
> My mouth is filled with honey

seedless

> Can I make your favorite meal before you move out?

invoice 

> Because of him lesser men have set their father's home ablaze
> And as the smoke billowed all those men became
> The boys they never got to be, never got to be

waft

> I can tell he loves deeply just by the fog he leaves in the air
> Already I need him


> He knows love can’t exist where there is cologne
> He knows I can’t fall in love if he’s wearing cologne

slow syrup

> I’m a glutton for “can we make this work?
> We can argue and leave room for dessert


> You need the calm, I need the world to end inside of me

bless ur heart
literally the WHOLE SONG

> When I give these books away will my ink betray me?
> Will my stories resist wings and grow feet and convince men that I'm boasting?
> Or will my psalms seek the company of lonely breaths?
> Will they inspire sudden lovers to kiss with mouths they don't have yet?
> Boy, whoever reads about how much I adore you
> I hope my words bring them something new


> With you I can empty myself of all my rivers and become a remarkable sky
> How could I keep these love documents to myself?
> How could I restrict what's given me life?
> Today I'll find a kind and burrowing creature that can carry these pages into the ground
> He'll recite the details of your love with his family
> And what was once a whisper will become a deep rumbling sound


> Boy, thank you for showing me how to be gentle [](https://genius.com/Serpentwithfeet-bless-ur-heart-lyrics#note-15720345)
> I have courage to share your love boldly

EP

blisters

> Concrete has hurried itself into bloom
> The mice have forgiven our greed
> Still you won’t kneel to kiss me
> My lips the only source of water for miles



> As your lips curl at the smell of sweetness in the room
> Keep tying your shoes
> You should know the world outside my door has tightened its womb for you
> Help me say the darkness of the leaves has come
> Forgiveness has not
> Tell him one more time, the darkness of the leaves has come

flickering

> I’m starting to feel the cord between us is made of gossamer


> I’m starting to kiss these bruises
> It hurts that you won’t join me

four ethers

> Your name is about as easy to remember as the four ethers
> And who the hell knows the four ethers?

Psychic

> My sweet, sweet mystic
> Are your lips too deep for kissing?

This hill

> And grinned when the grass called my step heavy
> My way to punish the Earth for asking me to live this long
