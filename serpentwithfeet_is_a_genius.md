# soil
### whisper 

> I love you from the space beneath my feet,<br>
> And beneath that, and beneath that

### messy

> I’ve been sitting alone for hours<br>
> Waiting for you to bring your ugliest parts to me<br>
> I’ve been naming our thorns for hours<br>
> Hoping you’ll treat them as kindly as you treated me<br>
> Oh, I've been thinking like a beast for hours<br>
> Wondering if you like the challenge of grooming me<br>
> After I glamour you for hours<br>
> Will you have the strength, the strength to extinguish me?


> Boy, I’m hungry but all my knives are dull<br>
> Will you sharpen your teeth to hunt and keep me full?


> When you’re burnt out and you’re praying for rain<br>
> Can I wish for flood? Is that okay?

### fragrant

> I called all your ex-boyfriends and asked them for a kiss<br>
> I needed to know if they still carried your fragrance<br>
> Baby boy, as their mouths, their mouths consumed mine<br>
> Their lips were sweet as yours, I hope your flavor stays in mind

### mourning song

> I’m sure my friends are tired of me talking about you<br>
> But it’s a gift, it’s a gift to miss you<br>
> What kind of lover would I be if I didn’t properly grieve?

### cherubim

> Boy, every time I worship you<br>
> My mouth is filled with honey

### seedless

> Can I make your favorite meal before you move out?

### invoice 

> Because of him lesser men have set their father's home ablaze<br>
> And as the smoke billowed all those men became<br>
> The boys they never got to be, never got to be

### waft

> I can tell he loves deeply just by the fog he leaves in the air<br>
> Already I need him


> He knows love can’t exist where there is cologne<br>
> He knows I can’t fall in love if he’s wearing cologne

### slow syrup

> I’m a glutton for “can we make this work?" <br>
> We can argue and leave room for dessert


> You need the calm, I need the world to end inside of me<br>

### bless ur heart
literally the WHOLE SONG

> When I give these books away will my ink betray me?<br>
> Will my stories resist wings and grow feet and convince men that I'm boasting?<br>
> Or will my psalms seek the company of lonely breaths?<br>
> Will they inspire sudden lovers to kiss with mouths they don't have yet?<br>
> Boy, whoever reads about how much I adore you<br>
> I hope my words bring them something new


> With you I can empty myself of all my rivers and become a remarkable sky<br>
> How could I keep these love documents to myself?<br>
> How could I restrict what's given me life?<br>
> Today I'll find a kind and burrowing creature that can carry these pages into the ground<br>
> He'll recite the details of your love with his family<br>
> And what was once a whisper will become a deep rumbling sound


> Boy, thank you for showing me how to be gentle<br>
> I have courage to share your love boldly

# Apparition EP

### blisters

> Concrete has hurried itself into bloom<br>
> The mice have forgiven our greed<br>
> Still you won’t kneel to kiss me<br>
> My lips the only source of water for miles


> As your lips curl at the smell of sweetness in the room<br>
> Keep tying your shoes<br>
> You should know the world outside my door has tightened its womb for you<br>
> Help me say the darkness of the leaves has come<br>
> Forgiveness has not<br>
> Tell him one more time, the darkness of the leaves has come

### flickering

> I’m starting to feel the cord between us is made of gossamer<br>

> I’m starting to kiss these bruises<br>
> It hurts that you won’t join me

four ethers

> Your name is about as easy to remember as the four ethers<br>
> And who the hell knows the four ethers?

### Psychic

> My sweet, sweet mystic<br>
> Are your lips too deep for kissing?

### This Hill

> And grinned when the grass called my step heavy<br>
> My way to punish the Earth for asking me to live this long
