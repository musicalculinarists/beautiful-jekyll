### Anika Cheerla

Resident cool kid, literally the harbinger of the AI revolution, vegetarian, Audacity technician, future metalsmither and embodiment of the singularity, cat fan, and can recite Kanye lyrics on command. MIT '23!

### Sarah Feng

Watch [our movie](https://youtu.be/4URMxcg7yQE), Birdsong: A Life, which some critics have said is the greatest movie of all time. Take that, Citizen Kane!
