# Butternut
Healy’s *Butternut* is all about emotional vulnerability, the subtle details in production, and that feeling of (as Khalil Gibran says in the Prophet): “know[ing] the pain of too much tenderness.”

(Sorry, The College Experience™ happened. But rest assured, we’re now back to our first and only priority, which is pretending we’re qualified to be music critics.)


![Subluxe, Healy’s first (and only) album.](https://i2.wp.com/atwoodmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Subluxe.jpg?resize=1050%2C700)


The fifth track on *Subluxe* is stripped down, production wise, with only the occasional gentle press of piano keys and train noises and the familiar *swoop* of text messages being sent. (The text message noises are kind of genius.) Healy’s voice has a vague tinge of static to it, almost like the track was recorded on an iPhone, except it comes off as emotionally raw and genuine and intentional rather than as just poor audio quality. The subtlety of the Production™ allows Healy’s voice and the actual lyrics to shine through, and goddamn do these lyrics manage to make you feel like you’ve just said goodbye to all your friends from back home and broken up with your longtime significant other and deleted all photos of the memories you had together off your camera roll.

Also, there’s still hope for new Healy music🙏🙏🙏:

He’s right. Let The Beat Build is an absolute banger and it has a completely different vibe to Butternut, but you should check it out anyway.
